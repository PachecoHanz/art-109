        <p> Hello! I'm Hanz Pacheco, a Filipino 3D artist based in San Francisco, California. 
            I always strive to create environments that tell stories rich with textures, light, and intricate details that have evolved organically over time. 
            Each process merges technical skill with an artistic sensibility, 
            allowing me to build immersive worlds that arenâ€™t just visually engaging but evoke a sense of place and atmosphere. </p>

        <p>  I am proficient in Blender, Substance Painter, and Aftereffects to make all of my models and 3D scenes. 
            I then use Photoshop, Premiere, and ClipStudio to create my digital illustrations.  </p>
